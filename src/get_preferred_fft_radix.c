#include "Mlucas.h"

/*
	Given a target FFT length via the [kblocks] argument, looks for a runtime-optimized *.cfg
	preferred-FFT-radix file (assumed to have been created via a set of timing runs on the
	platform in question). If one is found containing an entry for the specified FFT length,
	returns the preferred FFT length as the function result and the preferred radix set
	(assumed to have been determined previously via self-test on the host platform)
	in the RADIX_VEC global.  We define "preferred FFT length" here as follows:

		Given an input FFT length NI, the preferred FFT length NP is the FFT length >= NI
		whose .cfg file entry contains the smallest per-iteration timing.

	This may or may not be the same as the input FFT length, depending on how well we've
	done our FFT coding (especially for the less-smooth leading FFT radices) and the quality
	of the platform (compiler + hardware) which the code is built and run on. It also implicitly
	assumes that if we have timing data for at least one FFT length NK > NI, then we also have timings
	for any supported FFT lengths NJ lying between NI and NK, so as to have a full range of options
	from which to choose. (E.g. if on some platform we had a faster timing for 2048K than for
	1792K, we'd want to know that the 2048K timing is also faster than that for 1920K.)

	Looks for the platform-specific *.cfg file for the number type stored in the MODULUS_TYPE global
	(e.g. mlucas.cfg for Mersennes and fermat.cfg for Fermats) and if the requisite file is found,
	look for an entry for the input FFT length (in units of K doubles).

	If an entry for the input FFT length is found in the .cfg file (i.e. a timing-test run has
	been done for that length), compares that timing to the best of any timings found for larger
	FFT lengths and returns the best of these as described above, but in the following manner:

	1) Stores the best-timing FFT radix set data for FFT length [kblocks] in the NRADICES and RADIX_VEC[]
	   globals, irrespective of whether a larger FFT length with a better timing was found in the .cfg file;

	2) If timing for the input FFT length [kblocks] is better than any larger ones, function returns value = kblocks;

	3) If a larger FFT length with a better timing was found in the .cfg file, returns the FFT radix set data
	for that FFT length in a compact bitwise form in the return value, as follows:

		- Bits <0:9> store (leading radix-1): We subtract the 1 so radices up to 1024 can be stored;
			<*** EWM Jan 2014: For F33 we want r0 ~= 4096, so will need to modify the code here.
				Once we are dealing with r0 > 1024, consider storing e.g. [odd part of r0, lg(pow2 part)]
				in some compact fashion, say 6 bits for any odd component (allowing these up to 63) and the
				rest for the lg2(pow2(r0)) term. Thus e.g. r0 = 4032 = 63*64 would map to a [63,6] pair,
				needing just 6+3 = 9 bits to store, as opposed to 11 bits for (r0-1) = 4095 = 0b11111111111 .
			***>
		- Bits <10:13> store (number of FFT radices);
		- Each successive pair of higher-order bits stores log2[(intermediate FFT radix)/8]: Since
		  our smallest permitted intermediate FFT radix is 8 and these must be powers of 2, this
		  again permits radices up to 64 to be stored using just 2 bits. Radix-8 of course maps to 0
		  under this scheme, but we know when to stop because bits <10:13> tell us the number of radices,
		  which can be as large as 10 under this scheme.

	In order to make it easy for the user to extract these bitwise FFT-radix data from the function
	return value, we define 2 handy utility functions in util.c:

		uint32	extractFFTlengthFrom32Bit (uint32 n) - returns the (real-vector) FFT length encoded by n according to the above scheme
		void	extractFFTradicesFrom32Bit(uint32 n) - extracts the FFT-radix data encoded by n and stores in the NRADICES and RADIX_VEC[] globals

	If the return FFT-length value differs from the input [kblocks] (which implies that a better timing
	datum was found for at least one larger FFT length in the .cfg file), caller must decide whether
	to reset the FFT length used for the computation to the larger value - if so, caller can use the
	2nd of the above-described functions to read the corr. FFT radix data into the NRADICES and RADIX_VEC globals.

	Returns 0 if no .cfg file is found or if the .cfg file contains no properly-formatted entry
	for the input FFT length. In this case the caller should do a timing test at the input
	FFT length so as to find the optimal radix set on-the-fly, or simply use the radix set index 0
	(guaranteed to be supported if the FFT length is) if maximal execution speed is not crucial.
